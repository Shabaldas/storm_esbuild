      fdm_description: "FDM is an additive manufacturing technique that creates 3D objects by melting and extruding layers of thermoplastic material."
      fdm_tag_1: "The process starts with a digital model of the object."
      fdm_tag_2: "Using a heated nozzle, FDM printers deposit and solidify the material layer by layer, resulting in functional and durable prototypes or end-use products."
      fdm_tag_3: "One of the key advantages of FDM is its ability to print complex geometries with support structures that can be easily removed after printing."
      sla_description: "SLA is an additive manufacturing technique that creates 3D objects by melting and extruding layers of thermoplastic material."
      sla_tag_1: "SLA uses a UV laser to solidify liquid resin, creating detailed and precise 3D objects."
      sla_tag_2: "It's high resolution makes SLA suitable for intricate designs and prototypes."
      sla_tag_3: "SLA's layer-by-layer resin curing process allows for the production of intricate, functional prototypes and end-use parts with exceptional detail."
      dlp_description: "DLP is an additive manufacturing process that utilizes a digital light projector to selectively cure a vat of liquid photopolymer resin, producing 3D objects with excellent surface resolution and smoothness."
      dlp_tag_1: "DLP utilizes a digital light projector to solidify liquid resin into precise 3D objects, offering fast print speeds and smooth surfaces."
      dlp_tag_2: "With simultaneous layer projection, DLP enables rapid production of highly detailed prototypes and functional parts."
      dlp_tag_3: "ts ability to deliver fine details and smooth finishes makes DLP a favored choice for dental models, figurines, and custom designs."
